About Me
Hi, I'm Luka Tada, the person behind LukatadaNode. As a passionate Proof of Stake Validator, I am deeply involved in securing decentralized networks. With a focus on trust and security, I am dedicated to validating transactions and maintaining the integrity of the blockchain. Join me on this journey through the world of blockchain technology!

What I Do
With a commitment to decentralization, I validate blocks, ensuring network security and resilience. In addition, I provide detailed documentation to help others set up and manage their own nodes.

My Mission
My goal goes beyond validating blocks. I aim to lead the charge toward financial autonomy, actively shaping decentralized finance. With every validation, I’m helping pave the way for a future of accessible financial sovereignty.

Network Activities
I have been involved in various blockchain ecosystems, playing an active role in promoting decentralization and improving network resilience. Some of the projects I’ve contributed to include:

- NAMADA Testnet Validator
- AVAIL Testnet Validator
- NUBIT https://alpha.nubit.org/
- STORY PROTOCOL https://testnet.story.explorers.guru/validator/BA22AA1AA9ECFB5FD888EC26712C0A51D8B74A8C
All of which i can not provide details because it was Testnet.
